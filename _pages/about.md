I’m Pengyu Li (B.Sc., Xinjiang University, 2024). My primary research interest is artificial intelligence: from core learning algorithms and foundations to large-scale generative models and efficient on-device deployment. I enjoy working across the full stack — algorithmic theory, model design, training and evaluation, and systems-level optimization — and I aim to produce work that is both conceptually insightful and practically usable. I quickly prototype ideas into reproducible experiments and care deeply about rigorous evaluation and clear engineering. I’m applying to CS PhD programs and open to joining groups with a variety of research focuses and advising styles. If your group works on machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, speech/audio, systems (including ML systems and edge/efficient AI), algorithms/theory, or related areas, I’d love to talk.
