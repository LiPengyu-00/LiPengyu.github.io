I’m Pengyu Li (B.Sc., Xinjiang University, 2024). My primary research interest is artificial intelligence: from core learning algorithms and foundations to large-scale generative models and efficient on-device deployment. I enjoy working across the full stack — algorithmic theory, model design, training and evaluation, and systems-level optimization — and I aim to produce work that is both conceptually insightful and practically usable. I quickly prototype ideas into reproducible experiments and care deeply about rigorous evaluation and clear engineering. I’m applying to CS PhD programs and looking for advisors who value creativity, experimental rigor, and long-term impact in AI. If your group explores learning theory, scalable model architectures, continual/meta-learning, or edge/efficient AI, I’d love to talk. Email: lipengyv00@gmail.com
